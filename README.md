# FPGA_MotorControl

Designed a PID controller with FPGA hardware to implement position control on a servo motor.

Displayed the coordinates on the 4-Digit 7-Segment display, and output the error info to MATLAB.

The response time and the error was valued by a cost function with MATLAB, and the result was successfully under limitation.
